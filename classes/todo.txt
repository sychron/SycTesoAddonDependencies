Build Dependency Matrix
================================================
two dimensional "map/reduce" for dependencies
- gather dependencies recursively âœ”
- handle mandatory and optional dependencies separately
- just concat dependency arrys on the way up:
-- mandatory dependencies:
--- concat all mandatory dependencies of lower levels
-- optional dependencies:
--- merge all optional dependencies of lowerlevel
--- merge all mandatory dependencies of lower level!       <---- this is the important part

- after gathering, reduce both dependency arrays keeping the higher precedence version information
-- keep higher min version
-- keep lower max version
-- handle conflicts ( min version < max version)           <---- tricky ...

- do a sanity check:
-- check whether mandatory dependencies conflict optional dependencies
--- eg mandatory min version < optional max version
--- handle conflicts                                       <---- tricky ...

- save mandatiory and optional dependencies to matrix entry
- perform for every addon in list

Check Dependency satisfaction
================================================
- Traverse all entries of dependency matrix
-- traverse all dependencies of entry
--- check whether required addon is present
--- check whether required addon has correct version
--- mark entry as either satisfied or not satisfied
--- if possible, store a human readable comment to use later
