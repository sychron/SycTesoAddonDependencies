# SycTesoAddonDependencies
Pytrhon script to check dependencies of addons for Elder Scrolls Online

usage: 

put the python script in a folder inside your Documents/Elder Scrolls Online folder, next to the live folder used by ESO.

Or put it where you want and change the addon path in the first lines of the script.

Documents
| Elder Scrolls Online
|| live
|| SycTesoAddonDependencies
||| dependencies.py

when running the script, it will change the plugin text description files for all addons in the live/addons folder and print information about what libraries are used by which plugin, divided between mandatory and optional libraries.

the script will also compile a list of all addons with missing mandatory or missing optional dependencies, as well as a list of all files assumed to be a library which are not used at all and can possibly be uninstalled.

Please note that there is a "isLibrary" tag in the description files, but this is not mandatory and many libraries do not have this tag. Therefore, libraries are also recognized by names starting with "lib". But this generates false positives, as some "libraries" are in actually more or less standalone addons, for example LibAddonKeybinds.

After running the script, you can use the compiled information to install needed dependencies, uninstall unused libraries etc.



TODO

* add support for version checking. Version dependencies are recognized and listed, but versions are not checked when generating the output
* add support for nested dependencies, f.e. dependencies having dependencies as well. This will only work with addons installed, as this script is not intended to pull addon descriptions from any server.


Any Ideas?

If this script is useful to you and/or you have any suggestion, please leave a comment or feel free to contribute.

I know this is not the prettiest python code, but I decided to upload it now instead of having it sit on my disk for months waiting to be made pretty for release.
